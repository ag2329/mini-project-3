You can create your own User then you have create questions and answers or you can use existing user:

Username: anitikagupta@yahoo.com
Password: prajjwal


Epic: As a Laravel account holder I want to get an aggregated view of all questions posted by me and their corresponding answers.

Story 1 - Create a new view to display all questions and their answers.

Story 2 - Create a controller class to routing the request.

Story 3- Add new routes in routes.php

Story 4- Test the feature with an existing and newly created user.

Story 5- Deploy the code to Heroku.


Screenshot of working something.


The Home page shows the aggregated all the questions with the numbers of question associations, because there is one to many relationships between questions and answers.


 










When you want to see the questions with answer, you just need to click on “Show all Question and Answer” It will show all the questions and associated with answers on the page.
